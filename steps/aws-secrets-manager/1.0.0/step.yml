title: Fetch secrets
summary: Fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
description: |
  The main intention of this custom step is to allow storage of sensitive data on AWS Secrets Manager, and fetching them on-demand during Bitrise workflow execution.

  When a workflow runs, the step fetches a list of specified secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.

  The fetched secrets are then propagated into subsequent steps in the workflow.

  Checkout the main repository README for usage guide.

      A newline separated list of secrets to fetch from AWS Secrets Manager.

      Each line is in the form of:

      ```
      <Secret ARN> # <JSON object key> # <Environment variable>
      ```

      For example, given the secret with an ARN `arn:aws:secret-1`, and a secret value:

      ```
      {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "str0ngpassword"
      }
      ```

      Specifying this line in the secret list:

      ```
      arn:aws:secret-1 # username # USERNAME
      ```

      Fetches the secret, retrieves the JSON value under the key `username`, and store that value in the `USERNAME` environment variable. `$USERNAME` will now contain the value `admin`.
